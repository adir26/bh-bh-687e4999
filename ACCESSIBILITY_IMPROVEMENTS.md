# Accessibility Improvements

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive accessibility improvements across the application to meet WCAG AA standards and ensure the app works well with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Semantic HTML & ARIA Labels**
- Added proper `aria-label` attributes to all icon-only buttons
- Used semantic HTML elements (header, section, main) where appropriate
- Added `role` attributes for better screen reader support
- Implemented `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates

### 2. **Focus Management**
- Preserved and enhanced focus outlines with `focus:ring-2` classes
- Ensured all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Added proper tab order for modal dialogs and complex interactions
- Used `tabindex` appropriately for custom components

### 3. **Improved Screen Reader Support**
- Added descriptive labels for all interactive elements
- Used `aria-describedby` for form field descriptions
- Implemented proper heading hierarchy (h1 â†’ h2 â†’ h3)
- Added `aria-label` for context-specific actions

### 4. **Enhanced Loading States**
- Replaced generic loading spinners with structured skeleton components
- Added proper loading announcements for screen readers
- Implemented consistent empty state messaging

## Files Modified

### Core Components
- `src/pages/IdeabookDetail.tsx` - Added aria-labels, improved loading states
- `src/pages/PhotoDetail.tsx` - Enhanced image accessibility, button labels
- `src/pages/QuoteView.tsx` - Added semantic structure, proper button labels
- `src/pages/MyMessages.tsx` - Improved list semantics, button descriptions
- `src/pages/MyMeetings.tsx` - Enhanced empty states, accessibility labels

### New Components
- `src/hooks/useQueryInvalidation.ts` - Centralized query invalidation
- `src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx` - Accessible loading skeleton component

### Global Improvements
- `index.html` - Set RTL language and direction attributes
- Enhanced color contrast throughout the application
- Improved keyboard navigation patterns

## Testing Recommendations

### Automated Testing
- Run axe-core or similar accessibility testing tools
- Check color contrast ratios using WebAIM tools
- Validate WCAG AA compliance

### Manual Testing
- Navigate entire app using only keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys)
- Test with screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver)
- Verify all interactive elements have appropriate focus indicators
- Check that error messages are announced properly

### Key Areas to Verify
1. **Home Page** - Navigation, search, category cards
2. **Supplier Profile** - Contact buttons, favorite actions
3. **Product Details** - Image tags, product information
4. **Orders Page** - Order cards, status indicators  
5. **Profile/Settings** - Form inputs, navigation
