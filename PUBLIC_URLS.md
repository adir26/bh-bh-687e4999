## App Store Compliance Notes

### Guest Mode Behavior
- **Public routes**: Fully accessible, no authentication prompts
- **Protected routes**: Show LoginModal with clear call-to-action
- **Gated actions**: Authentication required before execution

### Post-Authentication Flow
- Users redirected to attempted action after successful login
- Seamless continuation of interrupted workflows
- Preserved navigation context and user intent

## Technical Implementation

### PublicRouteWrapper
```tsx
// Handles guest mode vs authenticated user routing
<Route path="/public-page" element={
  <PublicRouteWrapper>
    <PageComponent />
  </PublicRouteWrapper>
} />
```

### Authentication Guards
```tsx
// Protected routes require specific roles
<Route path="/protected-page" element={
  <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['client', 'supplier']}>
    <PageComponent />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

## Missing Routes Analysis

### Routes mentioned in requirements but not found:
- `/categories` - May be handled by dynamic category routes
- `/articles` - Not implemented in current routing
- `/article/:slug` - Not implemented in current routing

### Recommendation:
If article functionality exists, ensure these routes are added and wrapped with `PublicRouteWrapper` for guest access.
