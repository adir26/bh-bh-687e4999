# ATT/Tracking Removal Summary

## Background
The app contained NSUserTrackingUsageDescription in Info.plist without any active tracking functionality or ATT implementation.

## Action Taken: Path A - No Tracking
Removed all tracking-related references to align with no-tracking approach.

## Changes Made

### 1. iOS Info.plist - Removed Tracking Permission
**File:** `ios/App/App/Info.plist`
- **Removed:** NSUserTrackingUsageDescription key and description
- **Result:** App no longer declares tracking capability

### 2. Hebrew Localization - Removed Tracking String  
**File:** `ios/App/App/he.lproj/InfoPlist.strings`
- **Removed:** Hebrew translation of NSUserTrackingUsageDescription
- **Result:** No tracking strings in any language

### 3. Dependencies - Removed Tracking Package
**Package Removed:** `@capacitor/app-tracking-transparency`
- **Result:** No ATT-related code or dependencies in project

## Verification
- ✅ No NSUserTrackingUsageDescription in Info.plist
- ✅ No tracking strings in localization files  
- ✅ No ATT-related packages in dependencies
- ✅ No tracking SDK code in codebase
- ✅ App Store Connect should be updated to reflect "No Tracking"

## App Store Connect Declaration
When submitting to App Store Connect, ensure:
- Data collection declarations reflect NO tracking

- Privacy manifest (if required) should not include tracking domains

## Final Status
The app is now fully aligned with no-tracking approach and ready for App Store Review without ATT concerns.
