# Account Deletion Implementation - App Store Guideline 5.1.1(v)

## Overview
This implementation provides a complete in-app account deletion feature that allows users to permanently delete their accounts and associated data without contacting support.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Interface
- **Location**: Profile → Settings → Account Deletion (prominently displayed at bottom)
- **Clear Warning**: Explains what will be deleted with detailed list
- **Confirmation Flow**: Requires explicit checkbox confirmation
- **Success Screen**: Shows confirmation and automatically signs out user

### 2. Data Deletion Scope

#### Permanently Deleted:
- User profile and account information
- Personal favorites and preferences  
- Photos uploaded by user
- Ideabooks and saved inspiration
- Personal messages and chat history
- Meetings and appointments
- Personal analytics and search history
- Company profiles (for suppliers)
- Products created by user

#### Anonymized (kept for legal/business reasons):
- Orders and invoices (anonymized but preserved for financial records)
- Business reviews (anonymized but preserved for supplier ratings)
- Support tickets (anonymized but preserved for support metrics)
- Quotes and proposals (anonymized but preserved for business records)
- Leads (anonymized but preserved for business analytics)

### 3. Security & Audit
- **Access Control**: Users can only delete their own accounts
- **Audit Logging**: Non-PII audit record created for compliance
- **Database Function**: Secure server-side deletion with proper error handling
- **Two-Step Process**: Database cleanup followed by auth account deletion

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Frontend Components:
- `DeleteAccountModal.tsx`: Complete deletion flow with confirmation
- `Settings.tsx`: Added account deletion section
- Integration with existing auth context

#### Backend:
- `delete_user_account()`: Secure database function for data cleanup
- Proper RLS and security definer implementation
- Comprehensive data mapping across all relevant tables

#### Data Deletion Mapping:
```sql
-- Personal Data (Deleted)
